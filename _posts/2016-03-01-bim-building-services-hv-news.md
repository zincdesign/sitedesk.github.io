**Are you ready to answer the BIM questions you’ll get in April?**

In a new article for H&V News our Chairman, Michael McCullen, joins a panel of experts commenting on how businesses need to prepare for the April 2016 deadline for the BIM Level 2 Government mandate. The article examines BIM-readiness and the concerns about lack of preparedness for BIM. It also explores how BIM can help in all kinds of projects, not just those in for public sector clients.

In a new article for H&V News our Chairman, Michael McCullen, joins a panel of experts commenting on how businesses need to prepare for the April 2016 deadline for the BIM Level 2 Government mandate. The article examines BIM-readiness and the concerns about lack of preparedness for BIM. It also explores how BIM can help in all kinds of projects, not just those in for public sector clients.

Michael believes that the building services sector will see a change of proposition when it comes to centrally funded Government projects, he says: “The same type of projects will come up from the same departments, tendered for by the same contractors you are used to dealing with. At first it might seem as though nothing has changed – until you receive tender documentation or a questionnaire from a main contractor asking for confirmation that your organisation supports BIM.”

He goes on to outline the types of questions that building services and construction contractors can expect, such as what processes and procedures have been put in place to meet Level 2 BIM and whether the workforce has been trained in BIM. There are other specifics that these businesses need to know also: ““You will almost certainly be asked what design software you use and if you can work with the IFC data standard and COBie. You might even be asked what BIM project experience you have. You must be able to answer these questions – or you could lose out.”

With the April BIM deadline fast looming, there is still time to take action: “If you are not BIM-ready, now really is the time to act,” says Michael.
