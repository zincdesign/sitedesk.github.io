## BIM software review highlights

On Sitedesk’s ability to improve working processes by tagging information whilst navigating the 3D model, he notes: “the simplicity with which this can be achieved is replicated in the quick and easy way with which digital documents can be added to elements, systems and spaces and can be used to create digital workflows.”

David was impressed with the ease of use of Sitedesk. He also notes the ability to quickly view documents and activity and how simple it is to change model views. The powerful search facility was another highlight. It allows for searches for all kinds of area such as labels, types, dates, people and order.

Finally David underlines Sitedesk’s support in developing projects. He notes: “If there are special requirements in a project, the Sitedesk team will spend a day scoping the project to come up with solutions to problems that need addressing.”
