    We were initially worried about how to make best use of the data with all of the different tools that were being used on the programme. It quickly became apparent that we needed to identify a simple-to-use tool that enables us to use and capture information throughout the construction and operational processes that ideally can be used in the field. We managed to find a tool called Sitedesk.
