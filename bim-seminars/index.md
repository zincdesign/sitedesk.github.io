  <h3>Compliance and confidence: How to Activate the Benefits of BIM - 10am, Wednesday 24th May 2016</h3>
  
  <p>BIM is an active reality for contractors in the public sector space – and both a growing challenge and opportunity for those who work in the private sector too.</p>
  <p>Join Sitedesk for a lively UK BIM webinar presentation and:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> HEAR how you can save money and protect your margins with BIM.</li>
    <li> SEE how you can improve efficiency and reduce risk with Sitedesk software.</li>
    <li> UNDERSTAND how to move rapidly to BIM compliance and avoid missing out on contracts.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Join Sitedesk’s Director of BIM, Rob Umphray and Chairman, Michael McCullen, to discuss how construction contractors can transition from the theory to reality of BIM in daily business.</p>
