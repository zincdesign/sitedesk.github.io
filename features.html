      <p>Sitedesk helps you organise and manage your 2D drawings, 3D models, office documents, approval forms and more, as well as providing central viewing capability. Your information is all available within a single environment, and accessed from any device — even in the field when signals are undependable.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It provides a fast, flexible, uncluttered and easy-to-use construction collaboration and working environment for anyone involved in specifying, designing, planning, constructing, delivering, managing or maintaining a building or engineering project – whether your need is BIM project management or driving a traditional design and build.</li>

        <li>Sitedesk also operates as a unified data environment within which to manage operational, project and asset data throughout a building project. It forms a rich asset management or O&M database that can be easily transferred to a future building owner or operator, and to provide FM service providers with information that can seamlessly integrated via the BIM COBie schema with existing CAFM and asset management solutions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This multi-faceted construction software tool can eliminate the need to maintain and support separate project, operational and asset data environments, as well as replacing the need for separate field BIM and construction collaboration applications.</p>
