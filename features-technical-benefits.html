      <i class="icon-check green"></i>
      <h3 class="bullet">View and interact with 3D content in any open and many proprietary formats including mainstream 3D applications – without the need for any CAD licenses* and no matter how large the model.</h3>

      <i class="icon-check green"></i>
      <h3 class="bullet">Maintain a single set of contemporaneous records and centralised content, available to all. Create a single, linked and searchable as-built database from previously disconnected information, for future audit or discovery.</h3>

      <i class="icon-check green"></i>
      <h3 class="bullet">Map, manage and track detailed workflows for complete auditability and accountability. Familiar, flexible, intuitive user interface to enable a rapid learning curve and reduced time to ROI.</h3>

      <i class="icon-check green"></i>
      <h3 class="bullet">Mobile responsive application runs on standard spec computing equipment and requires no expensive, high-power workstation, extra memory or graphics processing power even when running multiple projects on a single machine.</h3>

      <i class="icon-check green"></i>
      <h3 class="bullet">Works fully online or offline with an innovative algorithm to maintain contemporaneous notes while offline and automatic synchronisation after signal restore.</h3>

      <i class="icon-check green"></i>
      <h3 class="bullet">Reduce information overload to site teams, by delivering only the relevant information and models that users need to see.Boost efficiency by creating digital template forms for use on multiple and future projects.</h3>

      <i class="icon-check green"></i>
      <h3 class="bullet">Create a fully searchable repository of operational and maintenance information including documentation linked to objects within the 3D model, workflows and supporting documentation, to support effective asset operation and future discovery.</h3>

      <i class="icon-check green"></i>
      <h3 class="bullet">Empower users, while at the same time driving accountability, tighter management control and good information management behaviours.</h3>
